### **Step 1: Prepare Your Docker Hub Account**
1. **Login to Docker Hub**:
   - Ensure you have a Docker Hub account. If not, create one at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).
   - Log in from your terminal:
     ```bash
     docker login
     ```
   - Enter your Docker Hub username and password when prompted.

2. **Create a Repository on Docker Hub**:
   - Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
   - Click on **Repositories > Create Repository**.
   - Name the repository (e.g., `todo-app-from-github`).
   - Leave the visibility as **Public** or set it to **Private**, depending on your preference.

### **Step 2: Tag the Docker Container**
Docker requires containers to have a tag associated with a Docker Hub repository name before pushing.

1. Identify the container image to tag:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   REPOSITORY          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
   ubuntu              latest    6c6e7a7d404d   2 weeks ago      29MB
   ```

2. Tag the image:
   ```bash
   docker tag <image-id> akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github:tagname
   ```

   Replace `<image-id>` with the `IMAGE ID` of your container. For example:
   ```bash
   docker tag 6c6e7a7d404d akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github:latest
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Push the Container**
Push the tagged image to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker push akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github:latest
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify on Docker Hub**
1. Go to your Docker Hub repository: [https://hub.docker.com/r/akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github](https://hub.docker.com/r/akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github).
2. Ensure the pushed image is visible.

Access the website via Docker when the container is downloaded to a cloud platform or any other machine:

---

### **1. Push the Image to the Cloud**
You've already pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub (`akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github:latest`). Now you can:
- Pull the image on any cloud server.
- Run the container with port mapping to expose the website.

---

### **2. Steps to Run the Container in the Cloud**

#### **Step 1: Set Up a Cloud Server**
- Provision a server on a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) or use a private server.
- Make sure Docker is installed and running on the server.

#### **Step 2: Pull the Docker Image**
Log in to the server and pull the image:
```bash
docker pull akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github:latest
```

#### **Step 3: Run the Docker Container**
Run the container with port mapping:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 akashdip2001x/todo-app-from-github:latest
```
Here:
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the cloud server.

---

### **3. Access the Website**

#### **Step 1: Get the Public IP Address**
Find the public IP of your cloud server. For example:
- AWS EC2: Check the "Public IPv4 Address" in the AWS Management Console.
- Other providers: Refer to their respective dashboards for the public IP.

#### **Step 2: Access the Website**
Open a browser on your local machine or phone, and navigate to:
```
http://<server-public-ip>:8080
```
Replace `<server-public-ip>` with the actual IP address of your cloud server.

---

### **4. (Optional) Secure the Setup with a Domain Name**
1. **Get a Domain**:
   Purchase or use an existing domain name.
2. **Point Domain to Server**:
   Update your domain's DNS settings to point to the server's public IP.
3. **Use HTTPS**:
   Use a reverse proxy like NGINX and tools like Let's Encrypt to enable HTTPS.

---

### **5. ⚠️ Alternative: Run on Local Machine and Use Tunneling (Port Forwarding)**
If you're running the container on your laptop and want external access:
1. Use a tunneling service like **ngrok**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```
2. Share the URL provided by `ngrok` to access the website from anywhere.
